## Python programming principles ([Zen of Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python))
- Beautiful is better than ugly
- Explicit is better than implicit
- Simple is better than complex
- Complex is better than complicated
- Flat is better than nested
- Sparse is better than dense
- Readability counts
- Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules
- Although practicality beats purity
- Errors should never pass silently
- Unless explicitly silenced
- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess
- There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it
- Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch
- Now is better than never
- Although never is often better than right now
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea
- If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea
- Namespaces are one honking great idea—let's do more of those
